# Benchmarks Directory (Temporary Minimal State)

This directory was intentionally minimized to remove XBOW content and reduce repo bloat.

**Tracking issue:** 
issues/54

## What’s next
- The benchmark harness is being refactored to dynamically reference and fetch required XBOW assets, and other benchmarks, at build/test time on the `feature/benchmark-refactor` branch.

If you’re looking for active work, see the refactor branch and the issue above.
